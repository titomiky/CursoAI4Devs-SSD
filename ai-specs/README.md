# AI Specifications & Development Rules

This repository contains a comprehensive set of development rules, standards, and AI agent configurations designed to work seamlessly with multiple AI coding copilots. The setup is portable and can be imported into any project to provide consistent, high-quality AI-assisted development.

It's highly recommended to be used along with Spec-Driven Development frameworks like [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec)

## 🤖 Multi-Copilot Support

This repository uses **symbolic links** or **naming conventions** to support multiple AI coding copilots without duplication:

- **`AGENTS.md`** → Generic agent rules (works with most copilots)
- **`CLAUDE.md`** → Optimized for Claude/Cursor
- **`codex.md`** → Optimized for GitHub Copilot/Codex
- **`GEMINI.md`** → Optimized for Google Gemini

All these files reference the same core rules in `ai-specs/specs/base-standards.mdc`, ensuring consistency across different AI tools while allowing copilot-specific customizations.

### Why This Approach?

✅ **Single Source of Truth**: Core rules maintained in one place (`base-standards.mdc`)  
✅ **Copilot Compatibility**: Each AI tool finds its configuration using its preferred naming convention  
✅ **Zero Configuration**: Import into a new project and it works immediately  
✅ **Easy Updates**: Update rules once, all copilots benefit  
✅ **Portable**: Copy this structure to any project  

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Import Into Your Project

```bash
# Clone or copy this repository into your project
cp -r LIDR-ai-specs/* your-project/

# The AI copilot will automatically detect the relevant configuration file
```

### 2. Verify Configuration

Your AI copilot will automatically load:
- **Claude/Cursor**: `CLAUDE.md` → `ai-specs/specs/base-standards.mdc`
- **GitHub Copilot**: `codex.md` → `ai-specs/specs/base-standards.mdc`
- **Gemini**: `GEMINI.md` → `ai-specs/specs/base-standards.mdc`

All paths and rules are configured to work seamlessly without manual adjustments.

## 💡 Usage: Command-Based Development Workflow

The most efficient way to work with this setup is using a command-based workflow:

### Step 1: Enrich the User Story (Optional)

If your user story lacks detail or acceptance criteria, use the **`enrich-us`** command to enhance it:

```
/enrich-us SCRUM-10
```

This command analyzes the user story and generates:
- Detailed acceptance criteria
- Edge cases and validation rules
- Technical considerations
- Testing scenarios

**Note**: Skip this step if your user story already has sufficient depth and clear requirements.

### Step 2: Plan the Feature

Use **`plan-ticket`** commands to generate detailed implementation plans:

```
plan-backend-ticket SCRUM-10
```

or

```
plan-frontend-ticket SCRUM-15
```

This creates a comprehensive, step-by-step implementation plan in `ai-specs/changes/`.

### Step 3: Implement the Feature

Reference the generated plan and execute:

```
develop-backend @SCRUM-10_backend.md
```

or

```
develop-frontend @SCRUM-15_frontend.md
```

The AI will follow the plan precisely, implementing each step with TDD, proper testing, and documentation updates.

### Example: Implementing SCRUM-10 (Position Update Feature)

#### Step 1: Enrich the User Story (Optional)

**You say:**
```
/enrich-us SCRUM-10
```

**AI enhances** the user story with detailed acceptance criteria and technical considerations (skip if already detailed).

#### Step 2: Generate the Plan

**You say:**
```
/plan-backend-ticket SCRUM-10
```

**AI generates:**
- Analyzes the ticket requirements
- Creates `ai-specs/changes/SCRUM-10_backend.md` with:
  - Architecture context
  - Step-by-step implementation instructions
  - Complete test specifications (validation, service, controller layers)
  - API documentation updates
  - Validation rules
  - Error handling strategies

#### Step 3: Implement Following the Plan

**You say:**
```
/develop-backend @SCRUM-10_backend.md
```

**AI executes:**
1. Creates feature branch `feature/SCRUM-10-backend`
2. Implements validation function with comprehensive rules
3. Implements service layer with business logic
4. Implements controller with HTTP handling
5. Adds route configuration
6. Writes 90%+ test coverage across all layers
7. Updates API documentation
8. Runs tests and verifies implementation
9. Commits and pushes (configurable to wait until confirmation)

## 🔧 Customization

### Adapting to Your Project

1. **Update technical context**: Find the different files in `ai-specs/specs` and modify core principles, coding standards, business rules and technical documentation to match your needs:
   - backend/frontend/testing/documentation standards
   - installation guide
   - data model
   - API docs
   - ...
2. **Adapt agents in `ai-specs/.agents`**: Adjust agent definitions to your project's roles and workflows
3. **Extend Commands**: Define battle-tested prompts into commands in `ai-specs/.commands` 
4. **Link Resources**: Reference your project's specific documentation or tasks using MCPs
5. **Keep the symlink structure**: Remember to create relative symlinks from claude and cursor folders to the newly created agents or commands to keep it consistent

### Maintaining Standards

- **Single Source of Truth**: Always update `base-standards.mdc` first
- **Version Control**: Track changes to standards like code
- **Team Review**: Standards changes should be reviewed like pull requests
- **Documentation**: Keep examples current with actual implementation
